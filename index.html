      <h2>The Standard</h2>
      <p>
        In the high-stakes environment of New York litigation and asset management,
        Mark Spitzer offers more than legal advice—he offers a fortress.
        Specializing in high-suit commercial disputes and private equity defense,
        his practice is built on the principle that the best victory is one the public never hears about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Educated at the vanguard of American law and seasoned in Manhattan's most demanding courtrooms,
        Mark maintains a boutique roster of clients to ensure personal, uncompromising attention to every detail.

      <p>
        Since 1973 Mark Spitzer has been at the forefront of many of the most famous
        world class suits and served as a steamroller in the case of longitude vs latitude.
        The world of litigation is no check to mark, it is merely a sign to contract
        and thus to real estate development.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The tide is sure with that which isn’t,” Mark said, to a fellow colleague
        at the Yolo conference a number of years ago.
