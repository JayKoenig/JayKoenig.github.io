          Since 1973 Mark Spitzer has been at the forefront of many of the most
          famous world class suits and served as a steamroller in the case of
          longitude vs latitude. The world of litigation is no check to mark,
          it is merely a sign to contract and thus to real estate development.
          “The tide is sure with that which isn’t” Mark said, to a fellow
          colleague at the Yolo conference a number of years ago.
